# HelpMePost — User Guide (non-technical)

This guide explains how to use HelpMePost in plain language.

## What it does

HelpMePost helps you:
- upload a few images/videos
- describe what you want to post about (the **Focus**)
- generate a draft you can copy/paste

It can also post to **Bluesky** (images only) if you choose.

## Step-by-step

### 1) Upload media

- Click the upload area and choose your files.
- You can upload before you fill anything else.

Tip: For Bluesky posting, select **1–4 images**.

### 2) Fill the Focus

The **Focus** is the most important field.

Example Focus:
- “A small Flask app that turns images into Bluesky posts”
- “Behind the scenes of my new video: lighting + edit workflow”

### 3) Optional fields: Audience, Tone, Tags

- **Audience**: who this is for (e.g., “indie devs”, “students”)
- **Tone**: the vibe (informative, excited, cozy, etc.)
- **Tags/hashtags**: keywords you want included

You can click suggestion chips to fill these quickly.

### 4) Options

- **Template Draft (no AI)**
  - Use this if you don’t want to use an API key.
  - It produces a simple, usable draft.

- **Add emojis**
  - Adds a light touch of emojis.

- **Call-to-action (CTA)**
  - Adds a short line like “Follow @you” or “Link: https://…”
  - If CTA is enabled, you must provide a destination.

### 5) Generate

Click **Generate Bluesky** (or **Generate Both** if available).

You’ll see results appear in the Results area.

## Posting to Bluesky

If you want HelpMePost to post for you:

1. Select **1–4 images** in the uploaded list.
2. Enter your Bluesky handle.
3. Create and paste a Bluesky **App Password** (recommended). This is not your main password.
4. Click **Post to Bluesky**.

## Tips

- If you see extra hashtags you didn’t type, that’s the app trying to improve reach based on your focus text.
- If you want “only the tags I picked”, ask to enable a “lock hashtags” mode.

## Troubleshooting

- **CTA won’t generate**: CTA is enabled but the destination is missing/invalid. Use `@handle` or a full URL like `https://example.com`.
- **Uploads fail**: large files may hit size limits; try a smaller file or increase upload limits on the server.
